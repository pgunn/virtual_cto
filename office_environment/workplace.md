# Office Environment
## General layout
Open-air offices are often more economical but should be avoided because it is hard for people to focus. Smaller offices, either small individual units or offices of 2-4 people are preferred.

## Lighting
Any lighting with flicker can cause headaches or unease that can be hard to pin down. Flourescent lighting should be avoided as it is particularly prone to this effect. Provided a non open-office plan is used, employees should be allowed to bring in (or expense, with a cost ceiling) standing lamps for indirect lighting if that is their preference.

## Food and Drink
There should be a variety of drinks and light snacks available, cost covered by the company. Several healthy options should be provided (potentially among less healthy options). If tea is provided it should be looseleaf with metal-cup style infusers available.
