# Separate IC and Management Tracks
For technical teams, management and individual-contributor tracks are distinct, without one being systemically higher than the other in salary, authority, or number of rungs available. It should not be unusual for an IC to have a manager that is lower-rung than they are. High-performing ICs should never be pushed towards management.

## The role of ICs
The role of ICs is to use their technical skills to do work (for engineering roles, this could range from programming to maintenance to managing infrasructure to tests to documentation to a variety of other things). To the greatest extent possible, ICs should be the ones to make technical decisions in the workplace.

## The role of Managers
The role of a manager is to evaluate and shape employee efforts towards both work and the workplace. They are responsible for happiness, productivity, evaluation, and (when necessary) discipline for misbehaviour. Managers should almost never be converted from engineers (they rarely have appropriate traits for this).

## The role of PMs
For companies that use PMs, a PM is responsible for helping ICs structure and track work. They can either be part of one team (in which case they and the manager overlap and coordinate more closely) or several teams (usually which work together). They usually (on their own or with other PMs) help structure commitments and expectations between teams (e.g. Team Gamma expects to have project X done by August, or Team Zeta would like to use this API for something new that will dramatically increase QPI, how much work would it take for that to be okay?). A PM is often technical, and often ICs will use a PM as a sounding board for technical ideas. It is common for PMs to be versed in some work-structuring methodologies (e.g. Scrum or Waterfall).
