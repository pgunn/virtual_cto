This is a set of technology choices that should serve any company with over 10 people that relies on technology for a significant part of its mission (or, for larger-enough companies, their IT departments). It names one or more products that I have seen work at various scales for various challenges. It is not exhaustive (or it would resemble a product catalogue), and it is biased towards my work-experience and full of my opinions. There is more than one way to do it, this is just what I'd advise in the general case were someone to come to me for advice.
