I recommend giving users a choice between Mac and Linux platforms, offering both in reasonable laptop and desktop configurations.

Multiple high-resolution monitors (on monitor arms) should be offered in workspaces, on sit-stand desks. Comfortable chairs (Herman-Miller has some solid offerings) should be provided.

The reasoning governing hardware purposes is that usually people time (from comfort to efficiency), converted to cost of employment and efficiency in meeting business meeds, outweighs the cost of hardware; workstation costs would need to be extravagant and very poorly justified to be inefficient over the duration of an employee's stay.
