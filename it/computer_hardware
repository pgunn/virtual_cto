I recommend giving users a choice between Mac and Linux platforms, offering both in reasonable laptop and desktop configurations.

Multiple high-resolution monitors (on monitor arms) should be offered in workspaces, on sit-stand desks. Comfortable chairs (Herman-Miller has some solid offerings) should be provided.
