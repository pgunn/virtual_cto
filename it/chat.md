# Chat
There should be official company chat for more rapid communication (with history) and for growth of company culture. I recommend using Slack for this, as there are good web and mobile clients and people are already used to it.

## Moderation
When the comany gets large enough, rules may need to be established for use of company chat. As in the general case, asking people to avoid a topic is less constraining than asking that certain perspectives in the topic not be expressed. More generally, the minimal amount of constraint needed to serve a need is preferred, even if this leaves some parties less than fully satisfied.
