For internal issue tracking, use Atlassian's Jira product. At least initially, start with the edition that they are willing to host, and have your IT people develop proficiency in it up to the point where they can build simple per-project workflows. Use this to manage everything from feature requests and bugs in product to support requests to IT.

Do not make your Jira public. Jira doesn't scale well, and making accounts for customers signs you up for a Jira instance that will slowly drag to a halt (or require custom work to prevent that).

For public bugtracking (if that's useful and you choose to do it), find a solution that lets people search for bugs similar to theirs so they can help themselves; this reduces support burden.
