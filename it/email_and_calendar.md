# Email and Calendar
I suggest using Google Enterprise Suite for email and calendar. It requires very little administration, doesn't require running servers, and gives you a lot at low cost. People are used to it, the spam filtering is very good, and there are good mobile clients for all mobile platforms. 

I recommend a company culture where people treat keeping their Google Calendar current seriously.
*All vacations, busy times, and the like should be marked in there
*meeting requests should go through Google Calendar after looking at somebody's available time through it
*Meeting rooms should be allocable through GCal (this is possible with some initial setup)

I recommend against using Google Enterprise Suite to manage DNS (this is an option when setting things up and should be avoided)
